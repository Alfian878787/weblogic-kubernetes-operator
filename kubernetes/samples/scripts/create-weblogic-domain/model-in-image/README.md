# Model in Image Sample

This sample demonstrates the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator "Model in Image" feature. Model in Image allows you to supply a Weblogic Deploy Tool (WDT) model that the operator automatically expands into a full domain home during runtime. This eliminates the need to pre-create a WebLogic domain home prior to deploying your domain resource.
